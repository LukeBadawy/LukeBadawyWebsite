# Website details
My person website project which will entail me doing the designs for it, planning, front end and back end. This will be used as a potential portfoilo in the future and for learning purposes.

###Things that need to be done:
1. I need to write out a document which entails what i want out of the website, what stack i will use and other things
2. I need to design the website in sketch and get a style guide that i like from my website.
3. I need to write a backend for the website which will not have much practical use in a portfolio but it will when it comes to learning.
